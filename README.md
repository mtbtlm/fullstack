# Film_Project
> A film project with Damien BALLATORE, Mathieu BARTHELEMY, Quentin POLGE

In this project, the goal was to develop an API to display and search films.


### Backend
For the backend part we used the flask framework.

We use a virtual environment for the backend, so you need to start one: go to backend\env\Scripts and type 'activate' in terminal.

Once it's done, go to the folder \backend\ and type "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal

Then type 'python base.py'. It is located at http://localhost:5000/

### Frontend 
For the frontend part we used ReactJs.
To start the application, first go to the root and type 'npm install' at least once, and then 'npm start'.
It is located at http://localhost:3000/



## User section 
When you are in the app, you can use the searchbar to search the film you want.
There are also three buttons that can show you the top 5 of films according to their category.

Here is when you press a button to get a top 5 films:

Here you can see what happens when we type 'cinderella' in the searchbar:
